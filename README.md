# fault_thesis
This repository includes the scripts and software that were used in my Diploma Thesis.

Table of Contents:

1. Matlab Live Scripts "*.mlx":
	Matlab Live Scripts, composed by me, Livadas - Stathakopoulos
	Ioannis (yiannislibad@hotmail.gr). These Live Scripts are licensed under
	the terms of the MIT license.
	
2. Folder "Matlab Scripts Used":
	Matlab Scripts (composed by other authors, some modified by me)
	used in the Live Scripts "*.mlx". The licence of those scripts is included
	(where applicable) inside their commentary.



In order for the scripts to work, a folder named "Project" should be created. Inside
"Project" folder, there should be placed:
	
	a) all Live Scripts "*.mlx" (contained inside "My Live Scripts" folder)
	
	b) the whole "Matlab Scripts Used" folder
	
	c) folder "sdm2011", which can be downloaded through the link below:
	ftp://ftp.gfz-potsdam.de/pub/home/turk/wang/sdm2011-code+input.rar
	(The SDM2011 software, composed by Dr. Rongjiang Wang)
